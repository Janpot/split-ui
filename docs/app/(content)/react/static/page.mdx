# Static Layouts

Static layouts use fixed sizes and flexible panels to create predictable, stable interfaces. These patterns are perfect for applications that need consistent structure and visual hierarchy.

## Three-Pane Layout

A classic layout with fixed sidebars and a flexible main content area. Perfect for dashboards, admin interfaces, or any application with sidebar navigation.

<DemoSection {...threePaneDemo} />

## Vertical Layout

Create vertical layouts using the direction prop. Perfect for header/content/footer layouts or any vertically stacked interface.

<DemoSection {...verticalDemo} />

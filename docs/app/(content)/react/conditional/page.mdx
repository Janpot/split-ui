# Conditional Panels

Conditional panels allow you to dynamically show or hide panels based on application state, user preferences, or responsive breakpoints.

## Dynamic Panel Visibility

Toggle individual panels on and off to see how the remaining panels automatically adjust to fill the available space. This pattern is perfect for responsive layouts, collapsible sidebars, or user-customizable interfaces.
